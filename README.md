R code for COVID-19 "Mortality Prediction Using Machine Learning-Integrated Random Forest Algorithm Under Varying Patient Frailty"

This repository contains the R code for the above-mentioned thesis project. Note that the data used in the project must be obtained by requesting access from the CDC's restricted access case surveillance data. Instructions for requesting access may be found here: https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Restricted-Access-Detai/mbd7-r32t. Also note that the included code was run on a March 2021 version of the CDC's data, and this specific iteration may not be available at a future date.
